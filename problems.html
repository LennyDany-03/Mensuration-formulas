                <p>Mensuration is a branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of geometric figures, including areas and volumes. Here's a list of essential mensuration formulas for various shapes, along with visual ideas for better understanding:

                </p><br>
                <p>2D - Shapes : <br>A 2D diagram is a shape laid down on a plane by three or more straight lines or a closed segment. Such forms do not have width or height; they have two dimensions-length and breadth and are therefore called 2D shapes or figures. Of 2D forms, area (A) and perimeter (P) is to be determined.</p><br>
                <p></p>
                <p> 3D - Shapes : <br>A 3D shape is a structure surrounded by a variety of surfaces or planes. These are also considered robust types. Unlike 2D shapes, these shapes have height or depth; they have three-dimensional length, breadth and height/depth and are thus called 3D figures. 3D shapes are made up of several 2D shapes. Often known as strong forms, volume (V), curved surface area (CSA), lateral surface area (LSA) and complete surface area (TSA) are measured for 3D shapes.</p>
